Welcome to our website! The SiG FSTM. Thanks for stoping by. Here are some information about us.

# Who are we ?
This whole website is made possible by a group of [FSTM](http://fstm.kuis.edu.my/blog/) student from [KUIS](http://www.kuis.edu.my) which we called SiG FSTM group unofficially :D. Most of us are having common interest in learning and understanding the computer technology.

In SiG we gather in a small group of people to share what we have learnt and interest us. Some of us also participated in programming/designing/CTF competition organize by other university or organization.

We are alumni, junior, senior of KUIS FSTM students. All gather in one small place to share and learn about the things we interest!.
