Based on the pictures above. The repositories name was sig-fstm.github.io with zero issues and zero pull requests and yes the fork, also zero. Everything starts from zero!

#### Repositories/Repo (Project name)
This is where you stores all of you project items. Every repositories can have many files, folders, images and everything you need to become one complete projects.

You can choose to make your repositories public or private. Private repositories can cost you some money. Consider to choose public repo and show some support in open source project!.

#### Issues
Issues is a bug tracker for github. Issues is where you keep track tasks, enhancements, or bug for your project. You can have a discussion on every issues your project have with all of your team or outside contributors (for public repo).

#### Fork
There is soo many open source project available for you to discover. You can fork one of them to get exact copy of your own version. Use it as starting point or help them to make project better by submit pull request.

#### Pull request
Pull request is the process where you want to merge your changes into orignal project repo. This process will notify owner project and get complete view of the changes you made and have discussion about the changes. If everythings working well, owner can merge it into original project.

Easy huh?
